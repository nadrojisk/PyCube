# PyCube

## Purpose

This is the course project for the Software Process class offered at Auburn Univeristy (Spring 2019) by Dr. David Umphress.
The students were tasked with implementing a rubix cube service. Requests would be parsed from the URL by Python's Flask and sent to the backend to be processed.

Students were expected to use the test driven development software process during this project.


## Structure
All the source code is contained within `RCube`. In the root directory there is a `microservice.py` file. This was provided by the professor.
Within `Rcube` is `test` and `xls`. `test` contains unit tests for this project. `xls` contains the reports that were submitted to the professor for grading.
Interactions with the backend happens through the microservice file.
